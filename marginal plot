If you want to show the relationship as well as the distribution in the same chart, use the marginal histogram. 
It has a histogram of the X and Y variables at the margins of the scatterplot.
Distribution will be displayed on top of the actual chart

library(ggplot2)
library(ggExtra)

#sample scatterplot
theme_set(theme_bw())  # pre-set the bw theme.
g <- ggplot(data, aes(x,y)) + 
  geom_count() + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se=F)

ggMarginal(g, type = "histogram", fill="transparent")
ggMarginal(g, type = "boxplot", fill="transparent")
